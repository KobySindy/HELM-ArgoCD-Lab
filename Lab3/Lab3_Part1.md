# HELM-ArgoCD-Lab3-Part-1

## In this lab we will Automate Deployment from helm Changes

## this lab will be diffrent, in this lab no code samples will be given and you will need to find the current solution by yourself

---

We will Update our original chart under the Helm folder.

1. Update the HELM chart values.yaml with the following and change the current value in the deployment file with the new helm template structure.
   - Set a new Parent Section named - "probes"
     - create a sub section named - "readiness"
       - create a key names - "path", with the value of the current path from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "initialDelaySeconds", with the value of the current initialDelaySeconds from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "timeoutSeconds", with the value of the current timeoutSeconds from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "periodSeconds", with the value of the current periodSeconds from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "successThreshold", with the value of the current successThreshold from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "failureThreshold", with the value of the current failureThreshold from the deployment file
     - create a sub section names - "liveness"
       - create a key names - "path", with the value of the current path from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "initialDelaySeconds", with the value of the current initialDelaySeconds from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "timeoutSeconds", with the value of the current timeoutSeconds from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "periodSeconds", with the value of the current periodSeconds from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "successThreshold", with the value of the current successThreshold from the deployment file
       - create a key names - "failureThreshold", with the value of the current failureThreshold from the deployment file
   - If you want to try working with tpl functions, replace all the templates with a tpl function

      ```YAML
      # tpl exmaple
                livenessProbe:
            {{- tpl (toYaml .Values.Probes.readiness) . | nindent 12 }}
      ```

   - Set a new Parent Section named - "volume"
     - create a sub section named - "mount"
       - create a key names - "path", with the value of the current mountPath from the deployment file
   - Add, commit and push to git to see if everything is working.

2. Add annotations to the deployment that after each new commit ArgoCD will rollout.

3. Change the annotations so it will rollout after the Configmap has been updated.

4. Update the index.html and see the deployment rollout the new change.
   - Change the "Testing Probes buttons" to "testing automated rollout"

5. Update the Chart.yaml to 1.0.1 Version to and create a new Helm Package and push it to the ghcr registry.

- Navigate to the sub_chart folder and update the dependencies of deploy1 and deploy2 to the new package 1.0.1
- Refresh/Sync the sub-chart applcation.
